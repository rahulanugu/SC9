          Like most website operators, ScriptChain collects
          non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
          and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
          language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
          visitor request. ScriptChain's purpose in collecting non-personally
          identifying information is to better understand how ScriptChain's
          visitors use its website. From time to time, ScriptChain may release
          non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
          publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
