### Landing Page Who we are 
> Who we are component is divided into 2 parts, the main one where the website displays all the employees, and the second where if you select one of them, it sends to a different page with the information of the selected worker.

1. Main page itself is divided into 2 parts as well, 1 which includes the workers and the other which includes the advisors.
> Every picture has a small text where it gives the name of the person and the role of him/her to the company.  
On top of that each picture has a hover effect making the picture a bit bigger to focus on the hovered one, and a clickable event sending to the page where the current employee is showcased.

2. The subpage is a more detailed information about the selected worker/advisor.
> It starts with the name, position and something about him/her. It continues with a picture and a new section of more information about the person. It can be ideas, achievements, or anything that the user wants to share about themselfs.
