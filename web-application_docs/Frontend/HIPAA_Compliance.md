### HIPAA Administrative Safeguards

1. Security Management Process - must identify and analyze potential risks to e-PHI; must implement security measures that reduce risks and vulnerabilities 

2. Information Access Management - implement policies and procedures for authorizing access to e-PHI only when such access is appropriate based on the user or recipient's role. 

3. Evaluation - perform a periodic assessment of how well its security policies and procedures meet the requirements
