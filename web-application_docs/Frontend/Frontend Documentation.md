**How we Code in Angular:**  

1. When creating a new component in angular, we use command:  
ng generate component component-name (replace component-name with the desired name of your component)
2. If this component is a webpage which has its own path, then add the path in "app-routing.module.ts" and include the component folder in head file.
3. If one webpage neads "login" before accessing, then add "HealthcareAuthGuard" or "PatientAuthGuard".

4. Component-based Architecture: Angular follows a component-based architecture, where the application is broken down into reusable and modular components. Each component encapsulates its template, styles, and behavior.
5. Templates: Angular components use HTML templates to define the user interface. You can use Angular's template syntax and data binding features to bind data from the component to the template.
6. Styling: Angular supports various ways of styling, including CSS, SCSS, and other preprocessors. We set styles in .css file.
7. Typescript: Angular applications are primarily written in TypeScript. TypeScript introduces static typing, interfaces, classes, and other features that help catch errors during development and improve code maintainability. We implement our major logic in ".ts" file.
8. Data Binding: Angular supports one-way and two-way data binding. Data binding allows you to establish a connection between the component's data and the template, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other.  
eg. We can define a value or function in typescript file and display or call it in html file.     
html:   
![Alt text](../Images/FrontendDocumentationCodeInAngular_images/image-2.png)      
typescript:  
![Alt text](../Images/FrontendDocumentationCodeInAngular_images/image-3.png)
9. About JWT token: When login, we get token from backend, and store token in localstorage (exmaple below are from patient-login component).
![Alt text](../Images/FrontendDocumentationCodeInAngular_images/image-4.png)   
Everytime we need user information, we can take token from localstorage, send it to backend and get information back. That's how we achieved "login" process.    
get token:

parse token:

**Things to be done:**

1. The provider sign-up page needs to be redesigned properly as per the user story.
2. The input labels on the become a partner page need to be left justified.
3. The social share buttons on the blog-post page and apply-job page have borders that need to be removed.
4. The send button on the contact us page needs to be centered.
5. Email templates do not show up properly when opened on an email on a web browser. That needs to be fixed.
6. Update graph model for the provider portal with charticulator <https://charticulator.com/index.html>
7. Front end landing-page component: In the typeScript file, the Onsubmit2 function is being called as soon as page is loaded. This is causing null values to be stored in the database. Backend controller: contactUsController. Make OnSubmit function be called upon submit button. Even though its within button parameters in typescript file, its being called every time page is reloaded.
8. Attach partnerships page to database and email api through the partnersController.js . send thank you pop up in onsubmit function in typescript file using toastr notifications.
9. Remove console logging from components if the functionality has been tested and everything works.
10. Fix the blog quotes text for each category, remove the "What __ is saying" template and make each title unique.
11. Organize the html and ts code, make it so the same format is used in similar files, remove unnecessary commented code, integrate imports for repeated functionalities, etc.
13. Integrate Django backend data with frontend patient portal. Make it so a patient ID is passed to backend and corresponding data is sent back.
13. Photo upload for sign up is not working, a photo is uploaded but not accessible.
14. Partnership form and sign up form makes call to backend but the database logging and email sending do not work.
15. Request Access form sends out a contact us email instead of a request access email on the dev environment.
16. # In both patient and provider portals, user needs to login again after 30 minutes whether they are active or not, we need to fix this.
17. Delete duplicate components on angular for webpages

**Important Note:**

1. When using http requests in back end controllers, include the correct headers in the backend
   ie: 
  ![alt_text](../Images/Frontend_images/image1.png "image_tooltip")

2. When a service file is returning a http request, make sure the typescript controller in angular has a .subscribe() inorder to send the http request to the server.
3. Email Templates don’t send out through new email system
4. Possible fix is to download handlebarJs Package
5. When creating a new component make sure to not add html or body tag, to avoid having duplicates of those tags on the page, which leads to scrolling issues.
6. All links and scripts should belong to the main index.html file 
7. Pem key file should be present in folder with db to access it.
8. Make sure, when trying to access mysql database, to use these credentials: check backend document!
9. When connecting front end component to backend controller, service file is needed as follows: (they are all in the shared folder)
check backend document!
10. Email templates are sent out via handlebars, which just accesses html dynamic web templates and is called via backend controller. Visit contact us controller to see example
11. Scrolling issues may appear as sticky if body head and html tag are stated. Remove these as angular framework automatically includes html tag. Never make CSS on any body html or head with angular. Move all those components to index.html where they can be called throughout the whole program.
12. Everything on database security access information is within the security groups and uses ec2 instance called "bastion host" to bring access to private subnet. So it sets rules from incoming traffic to only be those that have access to ec2 through pem key.
13. **WordPress-Blog-Image** : Make the image responsive on the blog directly on the Wordpress. Step 1: Click the image and click the **Edit as HTML**; Step2: Add the codes ` style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"` to the img tag
<img width="647" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38137877/235323247-28bba20d-033c-42cb-a47e-b3e8018a669a.png">


A. Responsiveness (Screen size: 300px, 800px, 1030px)
1. Patient portal (all the user stories) needs to be responsive entirely for all the devices except iPhone X.
2. Blog page needs to be responsive for all devices except laptops.
3. Main site ie. Landing pages (Compatibility statement, Faq, Contact Us, Main page, What is ScriptChain, Who we are) are responsive for all the devices
4. Become a partner page needs to be responsive for all the iphone and android devices devices 
5. Healthcare portal needs to be responsive for all the devices except 1030px sizes.

B. Validation is done for healthcare add user module but needs to be done to become a partner page. After the backend is done for the become a partner page other validations like phone number, message can be added. Confirmation email needs to be routed after submitting the request.

C. Connection of Front-end and Back-end once the backend is finished

D. Terms & conditions and Privacy policy components need to be modified according to the new design. Also, the link of both of them should be present under support or About us tabs in the main site wireframe.

E. Reset-password has not been included in any of the wireframes. Help button is present but it’s use is not confirmed whether it’s for forgot password or the customer support links.

  ![alt_text](../Images/Frontend_images/image37.png "image_tooltip")

F. Patient portal components (Risk Analysis, Risk Analysis Info, Prescriptions, Medications, Conditions, Lab results, lab result info, procedures and procedure name, Doctor) need to be built and hardcoded.

G. Telesign needs to be connected with the backend and integrated with the add user component under the healthcare module.

**Healthcare Provider Portal**

[**Microsoft graph link](https://charticulator.com/index.html)** 

**Frontend Framework for configuration modules : Gridster for Angular** 

[**https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-gridster2**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-gridster2)

**Two-step authentication:**

1. In healthcare-login.component.ts, the router needs to be navigated to the location mentioned there. In window.location.href, use whatever EHR is required.
2. This however has to be modified in a way as in when a provider signs in, they enter the EHR system, they have the bond with. We need to route to the EHR system as mentioned.
3. Note: Use Non-production client id for the access of the link
4. On hitting this, we will be seeing a login screen, which needs the provider’s credentials associated with the EHR.
5. The access token which is returned is stored in the backend service called, /storeInCache in the cacheController. With code(available in the url link, appended post successful login) as key and access token as value, the data is stored. 
6. Note: This is essential, since access token is obtained only once and needs to be used for all the requests.
7. /getFromCache is called to fetch the access token based on the code and make requests on behalf of the provider

**JDW - authentication comments:**

1. Step 1 of 5 of the [Standalone Launch flow](https://fhir.epic.com/Documentation?docId=oauth2&section=standaloneOauth2Launch) is implemented in the Angular application. The user is sent to an EHR login screen to gain access. This would give our entire application access to the EHR system via the provider login, which is not what we want. We want system level authorization, independent of the providers.
2. /storeInCache is never called from the Angular app, so no tokens ever make it to Node backend
3. Incomplete implementation (1 of 5 steps): not currently working
4. Authorization flow we need is the [Backend OAuth2 flow](https://fhir.epic.com/Documentation?docId=oauth2&section=BackendOAuth2Guide)

Next steps: Add Oauth flow to Django backend service; remove Oauth flow from Angular app/Node.js backend.
