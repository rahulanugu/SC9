**Default standards for every API:**

1. Used prepared SQL queries in order to prevent SQL Injections
1. Using static API KEY for now for accessing the apis - dynamic in development
1. Errors 400, 401 etc are standard
1. Every API has express validation before the data enters into the api
1. AWS’s SQL is used as the dbms here
1. Logging is in place in the AWS, needs to be enhanced
1. Mailer is used as per the requirement, new design schema is available


Things to be done:

1. Test cases need to be worked on and made sure that they are robust and work properly. They need to cover all aspects of the end point that it is testing.
1. Once all test cases work as desired, uncomment the code in .github/workflows/ci.yaml to run the tests as well when the CI/CD pipeline is executed.
