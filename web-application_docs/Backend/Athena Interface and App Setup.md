**Next Steps:**

` 	`Abstract api integration were ready and the api calls needs update so we can get the data points needed instead of getting all the data in one call. 

For ex: Current api calls gets complete information on a patient but Athena provides api calls that can get specific information on a patient reducing the amount of size of an api call and that is what needs to be decided on when the app is going to be published on athenaâ€™s marketplace. 

Refer back to FHIR excel spreadsheet for more information on the api calls. 

Frontend Suggestion: With the frontend being in angular, we can optimize it to make calls for a specific entity in the FHIR system. For Example: If a doctor wants to get information on one patient, the frontend should be able to directly request data via the backend without having to get more than needed information in a single call. Which means rendering the functions required on the frontend to reduce the load time to completely render the web page.
