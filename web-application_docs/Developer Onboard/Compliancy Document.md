### Transparency

The application provides a consistent pricing scheme for all the users and community members that will access the application. Any changes to the pricing schemes will be reflected in the pricing page of the application with additional notification alerts and an opt-out option for existing users. 

The user will have to conform to agreeing ScriptChain LLC user terms and conditions before using our application. 

**Note: Due to the application currently being in the development phase, no pricing strategy is enforced or being used. When the situation changes, we will have a pricing page made available to all the users.**




### Safety

The application is developed with user information security as the center of focus while providing state of the art features that are comprehensively represented. Development of the application has been done making sure that the proprietary owners of the data are who choose how their data is shared across the platform.

### Security

We ensure that a high level of encryption is enforced for data that is in transit to and from our application with the necessary authentication and authorization protocols. Also, for the safety of user data on the end user’s devices, the application is designed to expire a login session after a certain time of inactivity by the user. Also, a user’s login session is made to expire within 2 hours that would be due to the result of the JWT authorization token expiring.

### Privacy

Any user in the application needs to have the consent for viewing data of another user i.e the proprietary owner of the data. All the user data that will be collected by the application will be explicitly mentioned in the user terms and conditions that need to be agreed before the creation of an account in the system. Any changes to the terms and conditions will be followed by a user notification with reagree & opt-out options directed towards existing users of the application.
### Sharing
Any data that travels to and from the application will be done only with the consent of the proprietary owners of the data. The owner of the data can choose to abstain from data sharing for any of their concerns and the application explicitly announces the scope of their data exchange that will take place/


### Reliability

The application is extensively tested and debugged during the development process and will be continuously tested before the public release of the application. A plan for documenting and managing the defects in the system is designed to be put to use immediately following the public release of the application. Any data breach, privacy issue, security breach or bug that makes the system vulnerable will be followed with us notifying the users of the application and the community members. If necessary, we are also willing to suspend data exchange that might cause risk to either party involved until the issue is resolved.
### Efficiency

The application is designed to handle an enormous amount of incoming user requests to viewing and processing their data without causing any out of the ordinary load to the community member’s systems. There will be no unusual requests to the community member’s systems that might break or cause difficulty to their functionality and if any such request has been made, it is completely unintentional and the company is completely committed to immediately responding & resolving such issues with the highest priority, 
### Data Integrity

The application is designed to handle any data in the system without being corrupted or manipulated in an unintended way. Any material inconsistencies of data in the application are completely unintentional and will be resolved with high priority.
### Verifiability
We invite all of the community members to inspect and test our application to verify our compliance with the guidelines and FHIR API terms of use. 

**Note: The application is still in the development phase and not completely open to the community. But any release intended for beta or public use is open being tested & scrutinized.**
### Reciprocity
We intend to provide FHIR API-based Access to any relevant data that is collected by the application on the same terms as provided in the development guidelines of EPIC.
